    "### 🎯 Approach 2: Two Pointer (Overwrite & Fill)\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **My Breakthrough Realization:**  \n",
    "> After seeing my extra array solution waste memory, I had an insight: instead of collecting non-zeros in a separate array, what if I used a pointer to track where the next non-zero should go in the original array? I could overwrite positions as I scan, eliminating the need for extra space!\n",
    "\n",
    "The two-pointer approach uses one pointer to scan the array and another to track the position where the next non-zero element should be placed, achieving in-place modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Idea:\n",
    "1. Use a write pointer (`idx`) starting at position 0.\n",
    "2. Use a read pointer (`i`) to scan through the array.\n",
    "3. When we find a non-zero, write it at `idx` and increment `idx`.\n",
    "4. After placing all non-zeros, fill remaining positions with zeros.\n",
    "5. No extra array needed—everything happens in-place!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎨 Visual Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's trace through `nums = [0,1,0,3,12]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The Two Pointers Concept:**\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> idx: Write pointer (where next non-zero goes)\n",
    "> i:   Read pointer (scanning through array)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]\n",
    ">  ↑  ↑\n",
    "> idx i\n",
    "> \n",
    "> idx stays at 0 until we find a non-zero to write\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Step-by-Step Execution:**\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> Initial: nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], idx=0\n",
    "> \n",
    "> i=0: nums[0]=0 → Skip (don't move idx)\n",
    ">      [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]\n",
    ">       ↑  ↑\n",
    ">      idx i\n",
    "> \n",
    "> i=1: nums[1]=1 ≠ 0 → Write to idx=0\n",
    ">      nums[0] = 1, idx++\n",
    ">      [1, 1, 0, 3, 12]\n",
    ">       ↑     ↑\n",
    ">      idx    i\n",
    "> \n",
    "> i=2: nums[2]=0 → Skip\n",
    ">      [1, 1, 0, 3, 12]\n",
    ">          ↑     ↑\n",
    ">         idx    i\n",
    "> \n",
    "> i=3: nums[3]=3 ≠ 0 → Write to idx=1\n",
    ">      nums[1] = 3, idx++\n",
    ">      [1, 3, 0, 3, 12]\n",
    ">          ↑        ↑\n",
    ">         idx       i\n",
    "> \n",
    "> i=4: nums[4]=12 ≠ 0 → Write to idx=2\n",
    ">      nums[2] = 12, idx++\n",
    ">      [1, 3, 12, 3, 12]\n",
    ">             ↑        ↑\n",
    ">            idx       i\n",
    "> \n",
    "> After first pass: idx=3 (next position to write)\n",
    "> Fill zeros from idx=3 to end:\n",
    ">      [1, 3, 12, 0, 0] ✓\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why This Works:**\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> The array naturally divides into regions:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> [non-zeros written so far | unprocessed | ...]\n",
    ">                            ↑\n",
    ">                           idx tracks boundary\n",
    "> \n",
    "> After scanning:\n",
    "> [all non-zeros | need zeros]\n",
    ">                ↑\n",
    ">               idx marks where zeros start\n",
    "> \n",
    "> No extra space needed—we reuse the same array!\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logic Breakdown:\n",
    "* **Step 1:** Initialize write pointer `idx = 0`\n",
    "* **Step 2:** First pass—place all non-zeros:\n",
    "  - For `i` from `0` to `n-1`\n",
    "  - If `nums[i] != 0`:\n",
    "    - Write `nums[idx] = nums[i]`\n",
    "    - Increment `idx++`\n",
    "  - (Zeros are skipped, idx stays behind)\n",
    "* **Step 3:** Second pass—fill remaining with zeros:\n",
    "  - For `i` from `idx` to `n-1`\n",
    "  - Set `nums[i] = 0`\n",
    "* **Step 4:** Return modified array\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📈 Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:** $O(N)$\n",
    "- 🟢 **First Loop:** Scan all $N$ elements once\n",
    "- 🟢 **Second Loop:** Fill at most $N$ positions with zeros\n",
    "- 🟢 **Total:** $2N$ operations, simplified to $O(N)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$\n",
    "- ✅ **Only One Variable:** Just `idx` pointer (constant space)\n",
    "- ✅ **In-Place Modification:** No extra arrays or data structures\n",
    "- ✅ **Meets Constraint:** Satisfies the $O(1)$ space requirement perfectly!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚡ Performance Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing against my previous extra array approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Extra Array | Two Pointer | Winner |\n",
    "|:---|:---|:---|:---|\n",
    "| Time Complexity | $O(N)$ | $O(N)$ | 🤝 Tie |\n",
    "| Space Complexity | $O(N)$ | $O(1)$ | 🚀 Two Pointer |\n",
    "| Number of Passes | 3 passes | 2 passes | 🚀 Two Pointer |\n",
    "| Memory Usage | Up to N elements | 1 integer | 🚀 Two Pointer |\n",
    "| Meets Constraints | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | 🚀 Two Pointer |\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Impact:** Eliminated all extra space while maintaining linear time. This is exactly what the problem asked for!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verdict:\n",
    "✅ **Optimal for Space, Good for Time** — This approach meets the in-place requirement perfectly with $O(1)$ space, while maintaining efficient $O(N)$ time complexity. It's a solid, interview-ready solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎯 **Key Insight:**  \n",
    "> The two-pointer technique is powerful for in-place array manipulation. One pointer reads, the other writes—they work together to rearrange elements without needing extra storage. This pattern appears in many array problems!\n",
    "### 🎓 The Two-Pointer Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why This Technique is Powerful:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic example of the **\"Read-Write Pointer\"** pattern:\n",
    "```\n",
    "General Pattern:\n",
    "┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n",
    "│ [processed | current | unprocessed] │\n",
    "│            ↑        ↑               │\n",
    "│           write    read             │\n",
    "└─────────────────────────────────────┘\n",
    "\n",
    "Read pointer:  Scans through entire array\n",
    "Write pointer: Tracks where to place next valid element\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Applications:\n",
    "- Remove duplicates from sorted array\n",
    "- Move zeros to end\n",
    "- Partition array (even/odd, positive/negative)\n",
    "- Remove specific elements in-place\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Beauty:** Both pointers move forward, never backward. This guarantees $O(N)$ time with a single pass (plus optional cleanup pass).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "**What This Approach Taught Me:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Space-Time Isn't Always a Trade-off:**  \n",
    "   I eliminated extra space WITHOUT sacrificing time complexity. Sometimes you can optimize both!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **In-Place Doesn't Mean Complex:**  \n",
    "   Many people fear in-place algorithms, but this shows they can be straightforward with the right technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pointer Discipline Matters:**  \n",
    "   Keeping clear roles (read vs write) prevents bugs and makes the algorithm easy to reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Two Passes Can Be Better Than One:**  \n",
    "   While one-pass solutions exist, the clarity of \"place non-zeros, then fill zeros\" often outweighs the minor efficiency gain."
