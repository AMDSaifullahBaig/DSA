    "## 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]\n",
    "Output: 6\n",

    "### 📚 Approach 3: Stack (Layer-by-Layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🤔 **My Different Perspective:**  \n",
    "> After mastering the left-right maximum approaches, I discovered a completely different way to think about this problem. What if instead of calculating water column-by-column (vertically), I calculated it layer-by-layer (horizontally)? This led me to a stack-based solution that processes water in a unique way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stack approach calculates trapped water horizontally by identifying \"valleys\" between bars and filling them layer by layer as we encounter taller bars.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Idea:\n",
    "1. Use a stack to keep track of bar indices in a specific order.\n",
    "2. When we find a bar taller than the stack's top, we've found a \"right wall.\"\n",
    "3. Pop the stack to get the \"valley bottom.\"\n",
    "4. The remaining stack top becomes the \"left wall.\"\n",
    "5. Calculate the water trapped in this horizontal layer between walls.\n",
    "6. Continue until all layers are processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎨 Visual Walkthrough\n",

    ">   1. We've closed a \"valley\"\n",

    "> Key: We process water as we discover right walls,\n",

    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logic Breakdown:\n",
    "* **Step 1:** Initialize empty stack and `result = 0`\n",
    "* **Step 2:** Iterate through each bar with index `i`\n",
    "* **Step 3:** While stack is not empty AND current bar is taller than bar at stack top:\n",
    "  - **Step 3a:** Pop `top` (this is the valley bottom)\n",
    "  - **Step 3b:** If stack becomes empty, no left wall exists, break\n",
    "  - **Step 3c:** Get `left_end = stack[-1]` (left boundary)\n",
    "  - **Step 3d:** Calculate `width = i - left_end - 1` (distance between walls)\n",
    "  - **Step 3e:** Calculate `height = min(height[i], height[left_end]) - height[top]`\n",
    "  - **Step 3f:** Add `width × height` to result (water in this layer)\n",
    "* **Step 4:** Push current index `i` onto stack\n",
    "* **Step 5:** Return total result\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📈 Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:** $O(N)$\n",
    "- 🟢 **Single Pass:** Each element is pushed onto stack once\n",
    "- 🟢 **Amortized Pops:** Each element is popped at most once\n",
    "- 🟢 **Total Operations:** Each of $N$ elements: 1 push + at most 1 pop = $2N$ operations\n",
    "- 🟢 **Simplified:** $O(N)$ with slightly higher constant factor than two-pointer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:** $O(N)$\n",
    "- 📦 **Stack Storage:** Worst case stores all indices (when heights are strictly decreasing)\n",
    "- 📦 **Example:** `[5,4,3,2,1]` → stack grows to size 5\n",
    "- ⚖️ **Trade-off:** Uses $O(N)$ space like precomputation, but different algorithmic approach\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚡ Performance Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Performance:**\n",
    "- Slightly slower than two-pointer (more operations per element)\n",
    "- Similar speed to precomputation (both $O(N)$ time and space)\n",
    "- Much faster than brute force (linear vs quadratic)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verdict:\n",
    "✅ **Time Optimal, Space Moderate, High Complexity** — This approach achieves linear time but with $O(N)$ space and significantly more complex logic. It's intellectually fascinating but not the most practical choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎯 **Key Insight:**  \n",
    "> This solution demonstrates that the same problem can be solved with completely different mental models. While vertical approaches calculate water column-by-column, this horizontal approach fills valleys layer-by-layer. Both are valid, but some are more intuitive than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use:\n",
    "* When you want to demonstrate advanced data structure knowledge in interviews\n",
    "* Problems specifically asking for stack-based solutions\n",
    "* Situations where you need to process elements and their relationships in order\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When NOT to Use:\n",
    "* When simpler solutions exist (two-pointer is cleaner for this problem)\n",
    "* Time-constrained interview situations (explaining this takes longer)\n",
    "* When code maintainability is crucial (stack logic is harder to understand)\n",
    "* Production code where team readability matters\n",

    "#### 🚨 Common Mistakes I Made\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Mistake #1: Not Checking Empty Stack After Pop**\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> top = stack.pop()\n",
    "> left_end = stack[-1]  # ❌ Crashes if stack is empty!\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> **Problem:** After popping, stack might be empty (no left wall)  \n",
    "> **Fix:** Add `if not stack: break` after popping\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Mistake #2: Wrong Width Calculation**\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> width = i - left_end  # ❌ Includes the walls themselves!\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> **Problem:** Should only count positions between walls  \n",
    "> **Fix:** Use `i - left_end - 1` to exclude both boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Mistake #3: Wrong Height Calculation**\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> h = min(height[i], height[left_end])  # ❌ Forgets valley bottom!\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> **Problem:** Need to subtract the valley bottom height  \n",
    "> **Fix:** `min(height[i], height[left_end]) - height[top]`\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Mistake #4: Pushing Height Instead of Index**\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> stack.append(height[i])  # ❌ Lost index information!\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> **Problem:** Need indices to calculate widths later  \n",
    "> **Fix:** Always push index `i`, not `height[i]`\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Mistake #5: Not Understanding Why It Works**\n",
    "> Initially I just memorized the algorithm without understanding the layer-by-layer filling concept. Once I visualized it horizontally, everything clicked.\n",

    "### 🎓 Deep Dive: Why This Approach Exists\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The Philosophical Question:**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> If two-pointer is optimal ($O(N)$ time, $O(1)$ space), why learn this?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasons This Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Different Mental Model:**\n",
    "   - Shows water can be calculated horizontally, not just vertically\n",
    "   - Expands your problem-solving toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stack Pattern Recognition:**\n",
    "   - This is a \"monotonic stack\" pattern\n",
    "   - Appears in problems like: \"Next Greater Element\", \"Largest Rectangle in Histogram\"\n",
    "   - Learning it here helps with an entire class of problems\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interview Flexibility:**\n",
    "   - If asked \"solve it differently\", you have an alternative\n",
    "   - Demonstrates depth of understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Real-World Scenarios:**\n",
    "   - Some variations of this problem are easier with stacks\n",
    "   - Example: \"Find all trapped water regions separately\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The Stack Pattern (Monotonic Stack):**\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> General Form:\n",
    "> 1. Maintain stack in some order (increasing/decreasing)\n",
    "> 2. When order violated, pop and process\n",
    "> 3. Popping indicates we found a boundary/relationship\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Examples:\n",
    "> - Next Greater Element: Stack of indices in decreasing height\n",
    "> - Trapping Rain Water: Stack finds valleys between bars\n",
    "> - Largest Rectangle: Stack maintains increasing heights\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💭 **My Takeaway:**  \n",
    "> I initially found the stack approach confusing because I was stuck in the \"vertical\" mindset. Once I visualized water filling horizontally, layer by layer, it became clear. This taught me that the same problem can have radically different solution paradigms—choosing the one that matches your intuition matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stack approach is like filling a pool from bottom to top, detecting each layer as we build walls. The vertical approaches are like measuring each column's water depth individually. Both work; one is more intuitive (vertical), the other is more generalizable to related problems (stack).\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎯 **Final Thought:**  \n",
    "> Learn this approach not because it's better for this specific problem (it's not—two-pointer wins), but because it teaches you monotonic stack patterns that appear in dozens of other problems. It's an investment in your algorithmic vocabulary."
